<h3>Project Description:</h3>
The music streaming industry is highly competitive, with numerous tracks being released daily.
Understanding what makes a track popular is crucial for artists, producers, and streaming
platforms. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the popularity of
music tracks based on their audio features. By analyzing features such as danceability, energy,
and tempo, the project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that can help stakeholders make
informed decisions and enhance their strategies.

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
Develop a Predictive Model: Create a machine learning model that predicts the popularity of
music tracks based on their audio features. Identify Key Predictors: Determine which audio
features are most strongly associated with a track's popularity. Enhance Recommendations:
Provide insights to improve music recommendation systems and assist artists and producers in
crafting popular tracks.
